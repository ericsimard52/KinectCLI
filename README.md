# KinectCLI
Provides a Command Line interface to control Kinect from Xbox 360.

This project is very early in development. Expect problems.

  To build run:
  
  cmake ./
  
  make
  
  ./kcli
	
I know it needs libfreenect, I would like to know compiling issuesanyone encounters.

Working command:
- set led {off, red, green, yellow, blink green, blink red}
- set angle {int}
- trigger {rgb, depth}
